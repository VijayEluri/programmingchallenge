Pascal Triangle cool visualization
----------------------------------

Pascals Triangle can be used to approximate the Sierpinski triangle fractal
when there are 2^n rows. This entry calculates the triangle to a given number
of rows (it is really bad at managing the heap so be wary of anything over 1024
rows) and uses that information to generate an XBM graphic file.

Redirect the stdout to a file (e.g. pascal.xbm) and open up in your favourite
image viewer program. I've included a sample of 64 rows.
