The Temple Of Midgaard
You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Midgaard.
The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
picturing Gods, Giants and peasants.
Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
Equally large steps lead UP through a small door into the ENTRANCE to MUD
SCHOOL. (type 'up' to go to MUD SCHOOL.) A small plaque is on this wall.
	
Standing before you is Forest the temple monk. Maybe you should talk to
him. (type 'talk forest' to talk to him.)

The Abandoned Mud School
You are in an old building. Fine dust has settled on the floor and
cobwebs adorn the weathered walls. It is apparent that no one has
been here in quite some time. You notice that there are strange
animal footprints in the dust ahead of you.
	
Oh wait - why did it get dark all of a sudden?
	
Ouch! You have been eaten by a grue.

The Outskirts of the Temple
The area surrounding the temple has long been abandoned. The buildings
that still stand are on the verge of collapse and look like they will
fall over with the slightest breeze.
	
There are rumours that many past adventurers have walked these lands in
search of treasures only to be killed by local brigands. The most
fearful of these brigands is a troop lead by the infamous rogue known
only as NPE. You would like to find out what it stands for but she is
currently standing behind you thrusting a spear into your back.
