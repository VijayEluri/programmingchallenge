# Run Forest, Encode!

This is an entry to the Solium Programming Competition for March '15. The
rules were to write a simple compressor/uncompressor. The build here
creates those and assumes all file io will be handled by the bash shell.
Piping makes it so that I don't have to do that.

*However* if you want to have some **fun** than launch the server and
telnet to the port it echos. It'll be a trip down memory road for some.
