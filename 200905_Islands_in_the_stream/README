10  GW-BASIC -- old school to the EXREME!!!
20
30  A simple algorithm for a simple language.
40 
50  After loading the map into memory it finds a + and changes it to a
60  marker character. Then it proceeds to scan the map from north to 
70  south (and then south to north) changing each adjacent + to the
80  marker character. Once it does a pass without any changes it selectes
90  a different marker character and repeats the process with the next
100 land mass until there are no remaining landmasses.
110
120 Once it is done it counts all the different characters and prints out 
130 the result.
